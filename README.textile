h1. I18nLabel

Since labels don't use I18n in Rails 2.2 (I was too late in submitting the
patch), we'd have to make due with a plugin.

Installation and configuration consists of 1 easy steps:

# Run:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/iain/i18n_label.git


h1. Example

In your translation file:

  en-US:
    activerecord:
      attributes:
        topic:
          name: A nice name

In your view:

  <% form_for @topic do |f| %>
    <%= f.label :name %>
  <% end %>

The result is:

  &lt;label for="topic_name">A nice name</label> (please ignore the minor problem with html in github)
